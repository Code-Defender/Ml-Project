# Ml-Project
End-to-end Machine Learning project featuring classification and regression models with real-world datasets, preprocessing techniques, model evaluation, and performance comparison.

# Machine Learning Project – Classification & Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a complete **Machine Learning project** developed as part of an academic course.  
The project demonstrates the **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of results using real-world datasets.

Both **classification** and **regression** problems are covered to show practical understanding of different ML techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets  
- Perform proper data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Compare model performance **before and after preprocessing**  
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics  
- Understand the impact of clean data on model accuracy

## 📊 Datasets Used
All datasets used in this project are **publicly available on Kaggle**.

### 1️⃣ Classification Dataset
- **HR Employee Attrition Dataset**
- **Synthetic Heart Disease Dataset**
- **Diabates Dataset**

### 2️⃣ Regression Datasets
- **Car Price Prediction Dataset**
- **House Price Prediction (King County, USA)**
- **Life Expectancy Dataset (WHO)**

📌 **Note:**  
Due to Kaggle’s dataset usage policies, the dataset is not included directly in this repository.
Instead, the dataset has been uploaded to** Google Drive**, and the relevant access links are provided within the project notebooks.
Users are required to download the dataset and update the file paths according to their own Google Drive or local directory structure before running the code.
